      <p>1}  Out of six computer chips, two are defective. If two chips are randomly chosen for testing (without replacement), compute the probability that both of them are defective. List all the outcomes in the sample space.
The probability of choosing the first defective chip is 2/6 or 1/3 since there are two defective chips out of a total of six. Since we are choosing without replacement, there are now only five chips left, one of which is defective. Therefore, the probability of choosing a second defective chip is 1/5.
To find the probability of both events occurring (choosing two defective chips), we can multiply the probabilities together:
P(choosing two defective chips) = P(first defective chip) x P(second defective chip | first defective chip)
P(choosing two defective chips) = 1/3 x 1/5 = 1/15<p>



<p>A computer program is tested by 5 independent tests. If there is an error, these tests will discover it with probabilities 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively. Suppose that the program contains an error. What is the probability that it will be found (a) by at least one test</p>
